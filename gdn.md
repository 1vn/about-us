## Go Developer Network (GDN)

To better support our Go user groups worldwide, the Go community leaders at GoBridge and Google have joined forces to create a new program called the Go Developer Network (GDN). The GDN is a collection of Go user groups working together with a shared mission to empower developer communities with the knowledge, experience, and wisdom to build the next generation of software in Go. This network creates a single place for people to search for local user groups, events, and see what other Gophers are doing around the world.
